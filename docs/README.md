# Documentation

This directory is intended to store project-related documentation.  
Currently, it only contains this README file, but in the future, we plan to add more documents here, such as:

- **Setup Guides** – instructions for installing and running the project
- **API References** – detailed explanation of available endpoints and usage
- **Design Notes** – architectural decisions and rationale
- **Tutorials & Examples** – step-by-step guides to help new contributors get started

The goal is to keep all documentation organized in one place for easier reference and collaboration.
